# Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
A compilation of my MAT102 notes, typeset in LaTeX, from my time taking and
leading study groups for the course. The planned structure of the book is
as follows:

1. Numbers, Sets & Functions
	- Quadratic Equations
	- Inequalities
	- Sets
	- Functions
	- Fields
	- Exercises
2. Language and Proofs
	- Statements and Connectives
	- Predicates and Quantifiers
	- Proving Existential Statements
	- Unary Proofs
	- Conditional Proofs
	- Biconditional Proofs [todo]
3. Mathematical Induction
	- Sum and Product Notation
	- The Natural Numbers
	- Inductive Proofs
	- Sequences and Recurrences
	- Extending Induction
	- Strong Induction
	- Strengthening the Hypothesis [todo]
	- The Well-Ordering Principle
4. Bijections and Cardinality [todo]
5. Divisibility [todo]
6. Modular Arithmetic [todo]
