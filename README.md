# Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
A compilation of my MAT102 notes, typsetset in LaTex from my time taking and
leading study groups for the course. The planned structure of the course is
as follows:

1. Numbers, Sets & Functions
2. Language and Proofs
3. Mathematical Induction
4. Bijections and Cardinality
5. Divisibility
6. Modular Arithmetic
